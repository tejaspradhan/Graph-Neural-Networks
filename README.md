# Introduction

Graph Neural Networks take the concept of Graph data structure and try to model these graphs using machine learning. Most of the real world data can be modelled as a graph. This helps in creating a lot of good structures between the data. Applying machine learning to such graph data can help in giving solutions to a lot of problems like - protein folding, drug discovery, ETA prediction based on traffic.
